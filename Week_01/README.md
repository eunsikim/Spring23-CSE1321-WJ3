# Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

- We can technically write code on simple text editors such as Notepad or TextEdit.
- This can be cumbersome on the long run since it involves a lot of manual work other than coding, specially on large and complex programs.
- Most IDEs have lots of dedicated features to help you to focus mostly on writing code.
- IntelliJ and/or Replit
    
    >[!Note 💡]
    More info on how to install IntelliJ in the Lab 1 instruction manual.

    

# Main class and method

- No need to start talking about Object Oriented Programming yet, but classes and methods are a fundamental element of it.
- Whenever we run our code, we need to specify the computer from which point the computer should start executing our program.
- We specify this through the Main method.

```java
public class main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		...
	}
}
```


>[!Note💡]
The “name” of the should always match the name of the file you are writing your code. For example, if you are writing code in a file called “calculator.java”, then you should call the class “calculator”.

>[!Note💡]
The name of the `main` method is always main. This is because your computer will always look for a method called `main` to start.

- Most of the lines of code you will write throughout the semester will be done “inside” the `main` class and “inside” the `main` method
    
    >[!Note💡]
    By “inside”, we refer that the lines of code will go inside the curly braces ‘{ }’
    
    

# Command Line Interface

- To make learning and coding easier to learn, we will run our program directly into the terminal or Command Line Interface.
- Whenever you hear the word *Print*, we refer to the action of printing a String of text into the terminal.
- And whenever you hear the word ****Read**** or ****Scan****, we refer to the action of asking the end-user of the program for some input.
- Here is an example:
    
    ```java
    import java.util.Scanner;
    
    public class main{
    	public static void main(String[] args){
    		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    		int age;
    
    		System.out.println("How old are you?: ");
    		age = sc.nextInt();
    
    		System.out.println("Your are " + age + " years old.");
    	}
    }
    ```
    
    ***ExampleA.java***
    
    In this program, we print the prompt `"How old are you?: "`, then we wait for the user to input some value, then read the inputted value, and finally store the value into a variable called `age`. Finally, we do another print where we output the age of the user.
    

>[!Note⚠️]
 **From this point forward, assume that every code snippet goes inside the `main` method.**

# Introductory concepts

## Comments

- It is important to be able to write some information regarding your code in plain readable human language instead of code.
- But in Java you cannot write in English or any other human language, since the computer will not be able to differentiate between Java or English.
- To add comments into a Java file we use `//` for single line comments, and `/* ... */` for multi line comments
    
    ```java
    //Like this
    
    /* Or like
    	 this
    */
    ```
    
- Another example of commenting is what you need to add at the top of your code:
    
    ```java
    /*
    	Class: CSE 1321L
    	Section: WJ3
    	Term: Fall 2023
    	Instructor: 
    	Name: yourName
    	Lab#: 1
    */
    
    public class Lab1A{
    	...
    }
    ```
    

## Data

- One of the fundamental elements in programming and computing in general is data.
- We represent this data with binary values, 0s or 1s.
- A single value is called a bit.
- 8 bits = 1 byte
- Using binary numbers, we can represent values. For example:
    - 01000001 can be the representation of the decimal number 65.
    - 01000001 can also be the ASCII representation of the uppercase character A.
    - 00111110000000000000000000000000 can represent the decimal value of 0.125 using single-precision floating-point.

### Primitive Data types

- We call the following Data Types primitive because they are simple data that can represent a single basic values.
- These Data Types have fixed sizes, these are the following
    
    
    | Data type | Range | Size |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | byte | -128 to 127 | 1 byte |
    | short | -32,768 to 32,767 | 2 bytes |
    | int | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 | 4 bytes |
    | long | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | 8 bytes |
    | float | ~3.4 x 10^38 to 3.4 x 10^38 (~6-7 decimal digits) | 4 bytes |
    | double | ~1.7 x 10^308 to 1.7 x 10^308 (~15 decimal digits) | 8 bytes |
    | char | Unicode characters (0 to 65,535 or '\u0000' to '\uffff') | 2 bytes |
    | boolean | true or false values | 1 bit |

### Complex Data types

- Complex Data types are Objects. Shortly explained, an Object can have multiple data types (either primitive and/or complex)

## Variables

- Whenever we are running a program, there are certain data that we need the computer to temporarily hold.
- To do this, we create variables. Variables can represent a value (or multiple values as the program goes on).
- We can have multiple variables at once or throughout the program, therefore each variable should have an unique identifier or name.
- We also specify what type of value each variable should hold (a single variable can hold only one data type)
- A variable can only be initialized once. Like this:
    
    ```java
    short example = 1;
    short example = 4; // This is not valid, we already have initialized a variable called example
    ```
    
    ***********ExampleB.java***********
    
- To Read or Update a variable we can call it using its name
    
    ```java
    example = 4; // Updating the value of example to 4
    System.out.print(example); // Printing the value of example to the terminal
    ```
    
    *ExampleB_2.java*
    
- More example of variables
    
    ```java
    int integer = 1;
    short shortNumber; // We can initialize variables without an initial value
    float floatingPoint = 1.2;
    double doubleFloat = 1.4;
    
    char character = 'a';
    String string = "Hello World";
    ```
    

## Concatenation

```java
System.out.println("Hello" + " " + "world");
System.out.println("Hello " + someStringVariable);
System.out.println("The sum is " + (5 + someIntegerVariable));
```

***ExampleC.java***

>[!Note💡]
Assume that we already have a String variable called `someStringVariable` and that it has the value of `"world"`.
Same thing for `someIntegerVariable`, which has some integer value.

## Assignment vs equality

```java
x == y // Is x equal to y?, either true or false
x = y // Assign x with the value of y
```

## Quick I/O operations

- Print Statements
    
    ```java
    System.out.print("This prints a string, but does not leave a new line after it has been printed. ");
    System.out.println("While this print statement will leave a new line after it has been printed");
    System.out.print("See?");
    ```
    
    *ExampleD.java*
    
- Scanner/Read
    
    ```java
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    integer = sc.nextInt();
    ```
    

## Basic Arithmetic

| Operators | Symbol | Precedence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parenthesis | () | First (Highest) |
| Multiplication, Division, Modulo | *, /, % | Second |
| Addition, Subtraction | +, - | Third |

If there are any conflicts, the order goes from left to right.

```java
int sum = 4 + 7;
int sum2 = sum / 2;
System.out.println(sum2);
```

***ExampleE.java***

# Errors

- Syntax and Semantic Errors
    - Syntax: Something in your code is not valid or not recognized as Java programming syntax.
    - Semantic: Your code is valid, but it may not be what you intended to do.

## Examples of some errors

- Syntax error.
    
    ```java
    system.out.Println('Hello World'):
    ```
    
- Incorrect Logic or Arithmetic.
    
    ```java
    int blueMarbles = 10;
    int redMarbles = 4;
    
    System.out.println("There are " + (blueMarbles - redMarbles) + " marbles");
    System.out.println("There are " + (blueMarbles + redMarbles) + " more blue marbles than red marbles");
    ```
    
    *ExampleF.java*
    
- Incorrect out format.
    
    ```java
    int numberOfCats = 4;
    int numberOfDogs = 6;
    
    System.out.println("There are " + numberOfCats + " dogs and " + numberOfDogs + " cats.");
    ```
    
    *ExampleG.java*
