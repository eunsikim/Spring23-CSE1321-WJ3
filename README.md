## Assignments and Labs Submission
- Assignments and Labs are submitted through Gradescope
[Submission Guidelines](https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/fye/submissionguidelines.php)
- This is a Java section. Your source code must be with the extension .java.
	- Ex:
		- Lab1A.java

	- Any other extension will result in an automatic 0

- Name your files correctly
	- Ex:
		Lab 1 has three parts A, B, and C. When you submit them, make sure they are named as instructed:
		- Lab1A.java 
		- Lab1B.java
		- Lab1C.java

- Submit only what it is required, any extra file that is not .java will result in a penalization towards the grading of the assignment or lab.
- Carefully read the whole instruction manual, it may contain important and specific information and requirements.
